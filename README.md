## Involved with this amazing NGO
- Check their website <a href="https://www.jarit.org">here</a>. Their mission is to help migrant workers and people in the area of Valencia / Spain who have difficulties in changing their lives and adapting to this country. If like me you don't believe in borders and think we all belong to the same world and live under the same sun, consider donating to them.

## I speak 🇪🇸 🇳🇵 🇮🇹 🇫🇷 🇬🇧
- I also speak Valencian, a local dialect from my City.
